# Styling

The styling of Canvas is intended to be consistent with the rest of Nova, so it looks and feels first-party.

## Content

The content is styled using [Tailwind's typography extension](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

If you want to apply custom styling you can [register your own assets](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/customization/assets.html), everything is nested under the `.nova-canvas-content` class.
