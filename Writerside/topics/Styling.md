# Styling

The styling of Canvas is intended to be consistent with the rest of Nova.

You can change the colors of the field by updating `nova.brand.colors`, note this will affect Nova as whole not just this field.

## Content

The content is styled using [Tailwind's typography extension](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

If you want to apply custom styling you can [register your own assets](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/customization/assets.html), content is nested under the `.nova-canvas` class.
