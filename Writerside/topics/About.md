# About

The aim of Canvas is to be the ultimate WYSIWYG editor for Laravel Nova, without having to pay an expensive license fee, or having annoying branding plastered all over.

Canvas is 100% free and community maintained, built from the ground up to look and feel like it's part of Nova.

Under the hood Canvas is built using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/)
