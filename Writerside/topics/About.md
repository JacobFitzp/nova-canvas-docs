# About

The aim of Canvas is to be the ultimate WYSIWYG editor for Laravel Nova, without having to pay for an expensive license, or having annoying branding plastered all over.

Canvas is 100% free and community maintained, built from the ground up to look and feel like it's part of Nova.

Under the hood Canvas is built using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/)

I love what I do, and Canvas will always be free to everyone. That being said if you are feeling generous and want to buy me a drink that would be greatly appreciated :)
